# Catch Me If You Can - An FT Gamejam Entry

A simple game created in 48 hours during a gamejam in FÃ¸roya Tele. 

The purpose of the game for the hiding team (currently the player who hosts the game) is to not get get caught for one minute. In contrast, the seekers' objective is to catch the hider before the minute has passed. 

At the moment there is no in-game check to see if the hider has won the game, so if you for some reason want to play this, remember to keep a timer at hand.

Every player experiences the world differently. The map is an 8 by 8 grid of randomly generated rooms. Each player's grid is different, so it's possible that you're chasing someone who then runs through what from your perspective is a solid wall. Each player has the option to completely rebuild his entire world. This can be useful in some circumstances.

Controls: To move, just use any standard move input (e.g. WASD, arrows, controller). To rebuild your world, press R.
